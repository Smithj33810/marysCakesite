<h1> Semester 1 Project</h1>

<p>In my first semester at Hocking College I learned the following three things from HTML/CSS I and JavaScript I </p>

<ol>
  <li> That HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language </li>
  <li> That CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets  </li>
  <li> font-family is the property used to change the font of an element</li>
</ol>

<p> I also think that w3schools is a great resource to continue to learn more about web development</p>

<p> The link to the web app we created from <a href = "https://academy.hubspot.com">HubSpot Academy</a> is <a href = "https://powerful-refuge-85280.herokuapp.com/">Web App</p>

<h2> Certifications</h2>

<p> I also completed my first certification with HubSpot Academy.  I earned my Social Media certification.  Below is a copy of the certification.</p>
